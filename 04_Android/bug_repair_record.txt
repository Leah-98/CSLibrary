1.没有配置ndk的项目找不到ndk路径

This is a Gradle bug that is documented here:
[https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=228424__;!!JmoZiZGBv3RvKRSx!6F57goGNFLb4EYLUXBwDZGFSafDjvLziXFB8qOnuvbImT6NCNyUgK-UqxKuUw7Mm1dLXL2KN9jA6fILUNQU0LMF0PBo$ ]

 

The problem is that Gradle is computing the location of an NDK folder by just tacking on the string "/ndk-bundle" to the SDK folder location, even if you have never installed the NDK.

After establishing this false expectation of an NDK folder existing in a particular location, each time you build, Gradle gives you a warning that you're "missing" that folder. 

 

The solution was the following:

    1. Open project in Android Studio
    2. Wait for sync to finish
    3. Click on File -> Project structure -> SDK Location
    4. At Android NDK Location, if you don't have any NDK, install one
    5. Select an existing NDK location.

That should fix it.
